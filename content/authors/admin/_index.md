I grew up in Argentina, studied in the United States, and worked in Italy. Through my expereinces in commuities with wildly different levels of technological development, I became interested in exploring how access to technology shapes communication, culture, and morality. I also have a terrific sense ofÂ humor and a secret past as a rockstar.

In Italy, I worked at Bending Spoons, an Italian startup building human-centric mobile applications for 12 million daily users, researching and developing software to automate internal processes. Through my work at Bending, I contributed to Immuni, Italy's official contact-tracing application to combat the spread of COVID-19.

Before moving to Europe, I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at Harvard. There, I volunteered extensively with Engineers Without Borders, won several research fellowships, and participated of the Harvard Innovation Lab's Venture Incubation Program with one of the projects my roommate and I started. Addionatally, I was part of the teaching staff for courses in the Mathematics and Computer Science departments.
