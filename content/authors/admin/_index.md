I grew up in Argentina, studied in the United States, and worked in Italy. Through my experiences in communities with wildly different levels of technological development, I became interested in exploring how access to technology shapes communication, culture, and morality. I also have a terrific sense of humor and a secret past as a rockstar.\
\
In Italy, I worked at Bending Spoons, an Italian startup building human-centric mobile applications for 12 million daily users. There, I researched and developed software to automate internal marketing processes. Through my work at Bending, I also contributed to Immuni, Italy’s official contact-tracing application to combat the spread of COVID-19.\

Before moving to Europe, I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at Harvard. There, I volunteered extensively with Engineers Without Borders, won several research fellowships, and participated of the Harvard Innovation Lab’s Venture Incubation Program with one of the projects my roommate and I started. Additionally, I was part of the teaching staff for courses in the Mathematics and Computer Science departments.
